I recently created a {silly api} and wanted to showcase it's upvotes on product hunt.
I really liked the new {embeddable product hunt button}, but it didn't fit the theme of site.
So, I checked out the product hunt api, but was not interested in authentication.
To reduce stress on my server, I wanted to fetch the upvote count clientside, so this was not going to work.
That's why I made this. I simple solution to retreiving a post vote count.

I recently launched a silly api and wanted to showcase its upvotes on product hunt, but the design of the new embeddable button didn't fit in on the site.
So, I made this; A simple API for retreiving the vote count of your product.
Without the need for an API key or Auth, it is safe to do clinetside, reducing the stress on your servers.
